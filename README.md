# Supplier-Risk-Scoring
Supply chain disruptions cost companies an average of $184M annually (Source: McKinsey). Traditional supplier evaluation relies on quarterly reviews and subjective assessments. By the time issues appear in reports, production delays and quality problems have already impacted the bottom line.

This project develops a data-driven, predictive approach to supplier risk management that:

Identifies high-risk suppliers 30-60 days in advance
Provides actionable risk tiers for decision-making
Reveals key risk drivers to guide mitigation strategies
